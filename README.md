# -Excel-Project-Data-Cleaning-and-Macro-Automation-
This Excel project prepares an employee dataset for analysis by filling missing name and age values, formatting phone numbers, deleting rows with missing data, and filling in missing email-IDs. It also highlights the top 10 salaries, corrects department names, and fills in missing addresses. Macros are used for automation.
